## üéØ Demo Data & Test Cases

### Sample Audio Content (Record Yourself Saying):

#### Educational Content 1:
```
"Today we'll learn about the water cycle. The water cycle consists of four main stages: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection. First, the sun heats up water in rivers, lakes, and oceans, causing it to evaporate into water vapor. This water vapor rises into the atmosphere where it cools and condenses into clouds. When the clouds become heavy with water, precipitation occurs in the form of rain, snow, or hail. Finally, the water collects in bodies of water, and the cycle begins again."
```

#### Educational Content 2:
```
"Let's discuss the three states of matter. Matter exists in three primary states: solid, liquid, and gas. In a solid, particles are tightly packed and vibrate in place. In a liquid, particles are less tightly packed and can move around each other. In a gas, particles are spread far apart and move freely. Temperature and pressure can cause matter to change from one state to another through processes like melting, freezing, evaporation, and condensation."
```

#### Simple Greeting:
```
"Hello students, welcome to today's lesson. Please take your seats and open your textbooks to page 42. Today we will be learning about mathematics."
```

### Expected ASL Translations
- **"Hello"** ‚Üí Wave gesture
- **"Thank you"** ‚Üí Flat hand from chin forward
- **"Good"** ‚Üí Thumbs up
- **"Learn"** ‚Üí Book to head gesture
